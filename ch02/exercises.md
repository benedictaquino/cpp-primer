# Chapter 2 Exercises
## Exercises Section 2.1.1
**Exercise 2.1:** What are the differences between `int`, `long`, `long long`, and `short`? Between an unsigned and signed type? Between a `float` and a `double`?

**Solution:** The `int`, `long`, `long long`, and `short` types are integer types of different size. Unsigned types only represent values greater than or equal to zero, while signed types include positive, negative, and zero values. The `float` and `double` are floating point types of different sizes.

**Exercise 2.2:** To calculate a mortage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.

**Solution:** I would use the `double` for all three since I'd likely be using these variables for calculations and with mixed calculations any smaller types would be promoted to the larger type.
