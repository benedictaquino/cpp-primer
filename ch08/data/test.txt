Who am I? You sure you want to know? The story of my life is not for the faint
of heart. If somebody told you it was a happy little tale, if somebody told
you I was just your average ordinary guy, not a care in the world... somebody
lied. But let me assure you, this, like any story worth telling, is all about
a girl. That girl, The girl next door. Mary Jane Watson. The woman I loved
since before I even liked girls. I'd like to tell you that's me next to her.
Aw, heck, I'd even take him. That's me...
